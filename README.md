# Eboot
Eboot is project from about september of 2019, where we want to make using computers easier and better

Project has:
- a windows forms app
- a multi-platform console (Win32/Mac/Linux)
- a special OS designed to run project apps (you're here right now)

The OS uses lordmilko's i686-elf-tools(https://github.com/lordmilko/i686-elf-tools) for compiling on windows,
it will also work when compiling with normal cross-compiler on linux

How to setup cross-compiler on linux: https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler
